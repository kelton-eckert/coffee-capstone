ENGN 1001 Capstone Project

This is the repsitory for the electronics prototyping code. I am also logging progress and dumping other work for the project here.

Thus far the LCD, NANO, and temp sensor are connected on breadboard. 
The motor and power switch are connected but not yet working

Hardware challenges today. We met at 10:00 to work on motor. The motor I grabbed last time was a dud :[
Set up the motor and power switch on seperate breadboard - will be controlled w/an AND gate so only a signal from the nanon on the othewr board will control this board.
The 12V DC power supply didn't work when I tested it with the motor driver and motor - kept removing things but it seems to be the jack or the driver or the adapter.
~~[ ] get a thermometer in class tmrw~~
~~[ ] calibrate temp sensor~~

Built circuit with all 'final' physical parts. *My personal arduino NANO and LCD display are in the prototype bc the arduinos we ordered gave a firmware bug*
I have not tested the circuit yet.
The code from last update *(I did work I just forgot to write it down)* should need some minor adjustments to test the motor & pump. 
Going to scan in all ideation/prototyping material so that is saved for CDR.
CDR is on monday (03-31) so this needs WORK.

Started print of one of the parts for the model. Got motors (motor + pump) working. Scanned in ideation/prototyping materials.
Code updated to test motor and pump.
If print goes well, tmrw I will solder most of the circuit onto protoboard. 
Updated [schematic](https://github.com/kelton-eckert/coffee-capstone/edit/main/Schematic-03-29-25.png) that I made earlier today to match the working test circuit.
