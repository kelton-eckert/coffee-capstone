Thus far the LCD, Nano, and Temp sensor are connected on breadboard. 
The motor and power switch are connected but not yet working

Hardware challenges today. We met at 10:00 to work on motor. The motor I grabbed last time was a dud :[
Set up the motor and power switch on seperate breadboard - will be controlled w/an AND gate so only a signal from the nanon on the othewr board will control this board.
The 12V DC power supply didn't work when I tested it wuith the motor driver and motor - kept removing things but it seems to be the jack or the driver or the adapter.
[ ] get a thermometer in class tmrw
[ ] calibrate temp sensor
